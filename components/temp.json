Regent was born Deaf and has been an ASL teacher for more than 25 years. I was so happy he wanted to work on this project with me. This course will consist of ten lessons that have three videos each. The first video teaches you vocabulary, the second video teaches you sentences and the third video is a quiz that tests your knowledge of the lesson. We hope by the end of this course you will have a basic understanding of ASL and will be confident to continue your studies at your local College or Hearing Society. ",
